            <p>In October half term me and my family went to East Sussex and stayed at a farmhouse lodge.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this holiday, even though it was very rainy!</p>
<p>One day we even went swimming outside! It was freezing! We also went to the seaside and the waves were super strong. We had fun finding shells and rocks, drinking hot chocolates and eating caramel slices!</p>
<p>We met our cousins at Bedgebury Pinetum which was near by, a big woodland to explore and play in.</p>
<p>I enjoyed making fires in the wood burner in our lodge with my Daddy and playing snooker in the barn.  We also saw the animals - sheep, alpacas and a miniature pony.  The lodge also has a playground, it was fun but wet - my brother fell in a big puddle of water and was NOT happy.</p>
<p>We had food from a local farm shop, we had nice treats such as delicious meringues, halloween cupcakes and local apple juice! We also had a yummy lunch at a local pub restaurant called the The Great House - I had delicious pizza and chocolate brownies with ice cream!</p>
<p>It was a great time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Also in half term we carved pumpkins for Halloween. It was a family affair! My brother, Sam, did not like the smell!! Sadly, this year we couldn't go Trick or Treating. Maybe we get extra sweets next year?!</p>
